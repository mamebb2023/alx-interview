# Making Change
<h1>Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)</li>
    <li>Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total</li>
	<ul>
        	<li>If total is 0 or less, return 0</li>
        	<li>If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1</li>
	</ul>
    <li>coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession</li>
    <li>The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0</li>
    <li>You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list</li>
    <li>Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this task</li>
</ul>
